# sqlalchemypostgresutils
Custom configuration utils to use sqlalchemy and postgres

## What this project is about?

Sqlalchemy is a great library, it supports different dabase servers. Here in riffstation.com we use postgresql accross
several microservers, anytime that we need to create a new microservice we need to bootstrap common code again and again.
This library wants to concrate all database logic for our applications in one common place. Feel free to use it, extendent.
We are willing to hear about your suggestions and improvements
